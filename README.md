An Aragon OSx plugin for using a member/citizenship token alongside a voting power token.

## Abstract / Why


## Getting Started

## Usage

### Pre Requisites

Before being able to run any command, you need to create a `.env` file and set a private key as an environment variable. To test the contracts against the current Aragon OSx contracts on any of the supported networks, you must also set an Infura API key. If you don't already have an Infura API key, you can sign up for one at [Infura](https://app.infura.io/login).

Then, proceed with installing dependencies:

```sh
$ yarn install
```

### Compile

Compile the smart contracts with Hardhat:

```sh
$ yarn compile
```

### TypeChain

Compile the smart contracts and generate TypeChain bindings:

```sh
$ yarn typechain
```

### Test

Run the tests with Hardhat:

```sh
$ yarn test
```
