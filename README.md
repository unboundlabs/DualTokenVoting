An Aragon OSx example plugin using

- [Hardhat](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat): compile, run and test smart contracts
- [TypeChain](https://github.com/ethereum-ts/TypeChain): generate TypeScript bindings for smart contracts
- [Ethers](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/): renowned Ethereum library and wallet implementation
- [Solhint](https://github.com/protofire/solhint): code linter
- [Solcover](https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage): code coverage
- [Prettier Plugin Solidity](https://github.com/prettier-solidity/prettier-plugin-solidity): code formatter

based on [Paul Razvan Berg's great hardhat-template](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/hardhat-template).

## Getting Started

This `SimpleStorage` example plugin repository accompanies the guide on [How to write an upgradeable plugin](https://devs.aragon.org/docs/osx/how-to-guides/plugin-development/upgradeable-plugin/) from the Aragon Developer Portal.
It demonstrates how to

- write three successive builds of an `PluginUUPSUpgradeable` implementation and associated `PluginSetup` contract
- deploy them and publish them in an Aragon OSx `PluginRepo` created from the currently deployed `PluginRepoFactory`
- verify them with Etherscan
- write unit tests and integration tests against the currently deployed Aragon OSx protocol contracts

### VSCode Integration

This example is IDE agnostic, but for the best user experience, you may want to use it in VSCode alongside Nomic Foundation's [Solidity extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NomicFoundation.hardhat-solidity).

### GitHub Actions

This template comes with GitHub Actions pre-configured. Your contracts will be linted and tested on every push and pull request made to the `main` branch.

Note though that to make this work, you must add your `INFURA_API_KEY` as a [GitHub secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets).

You can edit the CI script in [.github/workflows/ci.yml](./.github/workflows/ci.yml).

## Usage

### Pre Requisites

Before being able to run any command, you need to create a `.env` file and set a private key as an environment variable. To test the contracts against the current Aragon OSx contracts on any of the supported networks, you must also set an Infura API key. If you don't already have an Infura API key, you can sign up for one at [Infura](https://app.infura.io/login).

Then, proceed with installing dependencies:

```sh
$ yarn install
```

### Compile

Compile the smart contracts with Hardhat:

```sh
$ yarn compile
```

### TypeChain

Compile the smart contracts and generate TypeChain bindings:

```sh
$ yarn typechain
```

### Test

Run the tests with Hardhat:

```sh
$ yarn test
```

### Lint Solidity

Lint the Solidity code:

```sh
$ yarn lint:sol
```

### Lint TypeScript

Lint the TypeScript code:

```sh
$ yarn lint:ts
```

### Coverage

Generate the code coverage report:

```sh
$ yarn coverage
```

### Report Gas

See the gas usage per unit test and average gas per method call:

```sh
$ REPORT_GAS=true yarn test
```

### Clean

Delete the smart contract artifacts, the coverage reports and the Hardhat cache:

```sh
$ yarn clean
```

### Deploy

Deploy the contracts to Hardhat Network:

```sh
$ yarn deploy
```

**⚠️ Please note the current [OZ `hardhat-upgrades` related issue](https://github.com/aragon/simple-storage-example-plugin/issues/5) leading to failing etherscan verification and the provided workaround. ⚠️**

## Tips

### Syntax Highlighting

If you use VSCode, you can get Solidity syntax highlighting with the [hardhat-solidity](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NomicFoundation.hardhat-solidity) extension.

## Using GitPod

[GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) is an open-source developer platform for remote development.

To view the coverage report generated by `yarn coverage`, just click `Go Live` from the status bar to turn the server on/off.
